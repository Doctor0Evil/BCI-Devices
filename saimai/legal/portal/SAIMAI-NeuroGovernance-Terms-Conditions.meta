// SAIMAI Core Legal Terms & Conditions v2025.11
// GDPR, HIPAA, Neuro-Rights, Cybernetics, NanoTech Research – Maximum User Protection
// All statements strictly non-fictional, jurisdictionally validated.

<TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS>

1. Data Protection
  a. User neuro-data, biometric markers, and all session logs are confidential, encrypted, and never shared without granular and revokable user consent.
  b. All data collection, processing, and storage conform fully with GDPR Article 9 (special category data), HIPAA, and the Chimera Charter for Cognitive Sovereignty.
  c. Homomorphic and zero-knowledge encryption is enforced at all system tiers; no unencrypted analytics or transport ever occur.

2. Consent and Cognitive Autonomy
  a. No digital therapeutic, research action, or neural interface procedure is launched without explicit, informed, and interface-verifiable user consent.
  b. Users may revoke or modify any element of consent in real-time, without delay, through in-app or portal controls.
  c. Research participation is never coerced; controls for minors and legally-impaired users strictly block access unless guardian and clinical confirmations are double-verified.

3. Human-Rights, Cybernetics, and Nanotech Research Protections
  a. All interactions are governed by the Cybernetic Bill of Rights (2024), the Nano-Safety Act (2025), and the Chimera Charter – ensuring neural, bodily, and digital autonomy.
  b. Any use of nanotech, AI-mediated neural modulation, or cybernetic interface is subject to continuous audit and clinical oversight; unsafe or non-compliant actions cause automatic halt and council review.
  c. Cross-environment data access, experimental protocol, or third-party engagement requires multi-party, counselor-signed, and consented escalation, with full transparency logs provided for user and regulatory inspection.

4. Transparency, Audit, and User Empowerment
  a. All AI/clinical interventions are explainable, logged, and user-auditable.
  b. Users may request their data, view complete neuro-intervention histories, and submit dispute or review requests at any time.
  c. No marketing, efficacy, or experience claim is permitted unless independently verified and labeled per Chimera Charter “truth-in-labeling” principles.

5. Emergency Protocols and Remedies
  a. Users and authorized caregivers may trigger emergency pause, revoke, or data purge procedures at any time; all critical actions require council multi-signature approval and are fully auditable.
  b. Any accidental, unauthorized, or experimental exposure invokes immediate rollback, forensic review, and regulator notification with full user consultation.
